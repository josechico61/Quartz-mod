# Quartz – Index

Order is not important for reading; this file simply confirms the project layout.
I’ll scan everything recursively.

## How to navigate
- Start at the root and open folders as needed.
- All files and subfolders are part of the study scope.

## Notes
- If any third-party or generated files exist, they may be skipped unless referenced by code.
- Large binaries (textures, audio) will be acknowledged but not analyzed line-by-line.
